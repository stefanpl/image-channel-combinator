# Image channel combinator

Combines different images into a single one, using each as a separate channel.

Uses sharp's [`joinChannel`](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/api-channel#joinchannel) function.

Use it:
- `npm i` I guess
- `npm run watch-ts` watches for changes and compiles TS into `dist`
- `npm run watch` runs the index file upon changes in `dist`
